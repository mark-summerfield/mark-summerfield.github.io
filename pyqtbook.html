This book teaches programmers how to write programs using PyQt&nbsp;4,
the Python bindings for the Qt&nbsp;4 application development framework.
PyQt&nbsp;4 is probably the fastest and easiest route into GUI
programming and works on Windows, Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X, and most operating
systems that use the X&nbsp;Window System, such as Linux and many
Unices. Note that the book is also useful for <a href="#pyside">PySide
programmers</a>. (Be aware that from PyQt4.6, PyQt now has two slightly
different APIs&mdash;but this only affects Python&nbsp;3 out of the box
and doesn't affect Python&nbsp;2 users unless they want it to.)
</p>

<p class="shout">
The book will be useful to people who program professionally as part of
their job, whether as full-time software developers, or those from other
disciplines, including <a href="https://www.pythonxy.com">scientists and
engineers</a>, who need to do some programming in support of their work.
It is also suitable for students&mdash;the only prerequisite is basic
knowledge of an object oriented programming language, for example, Java
or C++, or of course Python itself.
</p>

<p>
The book is ~550 pages (648 including the appendices and index), has a
foreword by Phil Thompson creator of PyQt, and is
published by
<a
href="https://vig.prenhall.com/catalog/academic/product/0,1144,0132354187,00.html">Prentice
Hall</a>. It can also be bought from other online and local book stores.
</p>

<p>
Only the printed editions are <i>definitive</i>&mdash;although available in
electronic formats, "ebooks" usually restrict your rights, and they are
often retypeset which can introduce errors. A legal PDF version is
available from <a
href="https://www.informit.com/store/product.aspx?isbn=0132354187">InformIT</a>.
Translations are arranged by the publisher and their quality can vary
considerably.

<p>
Part I is designed to quickly teach Python to non-Python programmers
so that they can use the rest of the book. This part is also useful to
Python programmers because it covers some of the non-GUI Qt classes, and
some of the Python techniques that are often used in GUI programming,
such as partial function application.
</p>

<p>
Most of the text is in Parts II, III, and IV. The chapters in these
parts cover similar ground to my <a href="sitemap.html">C++/Qt
books</a>, but have been written entirely from scratch with different
examples and written from a totally PyQt&nbsp;4 perspective. Also, some
topics are included that are not covered by my other books, for example,
the rich text engine, and some more advanced model/view programming
techniques.

<h3>Unsolicited Reader Comments</h3>
<ul>
<li><i>"This book is an absolute gold-mine, it's concise and practical
and shows examples which are applications in their own right, rather
than contrived ideas merely to illustrate a point."</i></li>
<li><i>"First of all congratulations on the excellent book! Its been a
fantastic learning experience and I'm having a great time with the
material you present."</i></li>
<li><i>"In contrast to many (most) IT-books I read, this book is a real pleasure to read."</i></li>
<li><i>
"It's been a very long time since I enjoyed reading a technical book
this much... a brillant job for one of the most underestimated
technologies available today."
</i></li>
<li><i>
"Your book 'Rapid GUI Programming with Python and Qt' is outstanding!  
I'm really enjoying it and PyQt is a pleasure to work with."
</i></li>
<li><i>"I am enjoying reading it and I am developing code at the same time."</i></li>
<li><i>"The book is wonderful... PyQt's model seems to be a good fit for my brain so far.
Thank you for writing the book!"</i></li>
<li><i>"I think that you managed to clearly get to the essence
of Python in very few words."</i></li>
<li><i>"I decided not to rush and not to skip `what I already knew' and I am
learning some quite interesting things even from the initial chapters."</i></li>
<li><i>"It's a very nice and comprehensive book..."</i></li>
<li><i>"I recommend this book to anyone that wants to learn PyQt, it is
an excellent book..."</i></li>

</ul>

<p>
To convert any particular example to PySide the steps are as follows:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Replace <code>python3</code> in the first line with <code>python</code>.</li>
<li>Add the following statements before the first import:
<pre><code>
from __future__ import division
from __future__ import print_function
from future_builtins import *
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>Replace <code>PyQt4</code> with <code>PySide</code> throughout (e.g., in the
imports)</li>
<li>If using Python&nbsp;2.6 replace <code>{}</code> in format strings with
<code>{0}</code>, <code>{1}</code>, etc., as appropriate.</li>
<li>Add <code>[0]</code> at the end of every <code>QFileDialog.*()</code>
function call. (In PyQt these return a&mdash;possibly
empty&mdash;filename; in PySide they return a filename&ndash;filter
2-tuple, but all the examples only need the filename.)</li>
<li>Replace <code>QT_VERSION_STR</code> with <code>qVersion()</code>.</li>
<li>Replace <code>PYQT_VERSION_STR</code> with <code>PySide.__version__</code>;
you will also need to add <code>import PySide</code> in the imports after
the future imports.</li>
<li>Replace <code>@pyqtSignature</code> with <code>@Slot</code>.</li>
<li>Replace <code>def isAlive(qobj): ...</code> with <code>def isAlive(qobj):
return Shiboken.shiboken.isValid(qobj)</code>. This assumes <code>import
Shiboken</code>. (I learnt this from Eric Thomson.)</li>
<li>Replace <code>chr</code> with <code>unichr</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
These conversions are sufficient in most cases. However, a few of the
examples' behavior is not correct even after these changes. And
unfortunately, I don't have the time to investigate.
</p>

For more information on the tools the book teaches see the <a

the <a href="https://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk">Riverbank website</a>
(makers of PyQt&nbsp;4), and the <a href="https://www.pyside.org">PySide
website</a> (makers of PySide, official Nokia-sponsored Python bindings
for Qt, largely PyQt compatible). And for those interested in scientific
and engineering programming the <a

should be of interest.
