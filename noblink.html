<p>
A minority of people cannot work with blinking or flashing cursors. In
today's globalized community even a “minority” is still a <b>lot</b> of
people. Yet software providers often ignore these peoples' needs.
</p>

<p>
Apple used to respect such people, and prior to OS&nbsp;X provided a
means of turning off cursor blink globally across all applications. This
feature was dropped with OS&nbsp;X. Now it is only possible to turn off
cursor blink on some applications&mdash;and this must be done on a
case-by-case basis.
</p>

<p>
Microsoft built cursor blink into MS-DOS and then into Windows. However,
even from Windows&nbsp;3, it was possible to work around this. I wrote a
tiny program that executed in the background and that every 0.5 seconds
reset the cursor blink rate to 0. This stopped cursor blink in all
Windows applications that used the standard Windows APIs; although
ironically this meant that the cursor disappeared in Word and continued
to blink in Excel. Since 2000, Microsoft has respected the needs of
people who can't work with blinking cursors and allows cursor blink to
be turned off globally.
</p>

<p>
In the Linux world, all decent terminals have long offered the user the
choice of blinking or non-blinking cursors. And most Linux Window
systems also provide a global solution&mdash;at least for applications
written for the particular Window system the user is using. Thus, it is
possible to globally turn off cursor blink for all GNOME&nbsp;2
applications (I don't use or know about GNOME&nbsp;3), and for KDE
applications that are based on Qt&nbsp;3 or Qt&nbsp;4.
</p>

<p>
For more information about turning off cursor blink see 
<a href="https://www.jurta.org/en/prog/noblink">
www.jurta.org/en/prog/noblink</a>.
Although the JURTA site is very useful, it doesn't help with
applications that use Tcl/Tk's themed widgets (which have cursor blink
but which don't respect the <code>insertOffTime</code> option), or with
Qt&nbsp;5.0.0 applications which take their blink rate from the theme
and seem to ignore user preferences. In both cases a solution is
possible, but involves rebuilding these libraries from source.
Note that more modern Qt&nbsp;5 versions do respect the user's blink
rate&mdash;but only on Windows.
</p>

<h2>Non-blinking Tcl/Tk</h2>
<p>
This can be achieved for “classic” and <code>ttk</code> widgets with
these two commands:
<pre>
option add *insertOffTime 0
ttk::style configure . -insertofftime 0
</pre>
</p>

<h2>Non-blinking Qt</h2>
<p>
Use the Qt Config application (<code>qt5ct</code> or <code>qt6ct</code>)
and set the Cursor flash time in the Interface tab to 0.
