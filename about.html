<h3>History</h3>

<p>
Qtrac Ltd. was founded in 2006, traded until 2024, and was wound up in
2025.<sup>*</sup>
</p>

<p>
The “Qtrac” in Qtrac Ltd. stood for “Quality Training Research And
Consultancy”. Qtrac Ltd. began with the intention of providing
programming training courses. However, in its first eight years it
mostly earned money from the books written by <a
href="marksummerfield.html">Mark Summerfield</a> its owner and sole
employee, plus income from providing technical writing services and
programming training courses. During Qtrac Ltd.'s last decade, most of
its income was generated by license sales of its PDF comparison
products, in particular the <a href="diffpdf.html">DiffPDF</a> GUI
application and the more technical <a
href="comparepdfcmd.html">comparepdfcmd</a> tool (itself the successor
to the diffpdfc tool).
</p>

<p>
For many years we also produced a wide variety of free open source
software, mostly small libraries and utilities created using many
different programming languages, as well as a free open source DiffPDF
application now maintained by others. However, In view of the EU’s Cyber
Resilience Act and an abundance of caution, we have withdrawn all our
free software.
</p>

<p><sup>*</sup>
<span style="font-size: 90%;">Qtrac Ltd was a Digital River/MyCommerce
customer and its closure was precipitated by Digital River's refusal to
pay its debts to its customers.
