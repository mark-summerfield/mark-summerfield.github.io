<p class="blue">This software is no longer for sale.</p>

<h3>2.5.0-pe “perpetual edition”</h3>
<ul>
<li>Same functionality as 2.4.2.</li>
<li>This is the final version of the software. It does not need or use a license key.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.4.2</h3>
<ul>
<li>New <code>.csv</code> output format. By default
<code>comparepdfcmd</code> will output in the “normal” <code>.csv</code>
format. However, if the <code>-C</code> or <code>--config</code> option
is used and the configuration file contains the lines:
<pre>
[report]
csv=special
</pre>
then the new format will be used. These formats are both described in
the manual.
</li>
<li>Fixed bug which meant that some PDF reports did not show the
changes. This bug is <i>extremely</i> rare and due to a bug in the PDF
library which we use and which we have now worked around.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.4.1</h3>
<ul>
<li>License clarification.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.4.0</h3>
<ul>
<li>Switched to annual license keys only. These are not tied to the
hardware and may be transferred (moved) freely from one computer to
another. These licenses can be purchased singly. (Existing “full”
license keys continue to work normally.) Run <code>comparepdfcmd.exe
-h</code> to see (at the end) which license key is in use, what its
expiry is, and where the key is located.</li>
<li>License changes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.3.3</h3>
<ul>
<li>License changes.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>2.3.2</h3>
<ul>
<li>Library updates.</li>
<li>License changes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.3.1</h3>
<ul>
<li>Updated libraries—in many cases, faster than ever.</li>
<li>A Windows update caused <code>comparepdfcmd.exe cid</code> to
<i>sometimes</i> output
<code>WMI error: HRESULT Call failed with: 0x80010119</code>.
This should now be fixed.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.3.0</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added new <code>[report]</code> option <code>scalablepdf=true</code>. By
default <i>comparepdfcmd</i> outputs scalable PDF reports, but in some rare
cases this can fail. For such cases use a configuration file with a
<code>[report]</code> section that has <code>scalablepdf=false</code>; this will
output PDF reports the same way that <i>diffpdfc</i> does.</li>
<li>Updated libraries and various minor code improvements.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.2.3</h3>
<ul>
<li>Updated libraries and various minor code improvements. In some
cases, slightly faster (especially on Windows 7).</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.2.2</h3>
<ul>
<li>Updated libraries and various minor code improvements. In many
cases, significantly faster on Windows 7.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.2.1</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a subtle bug where pages with no text produced an error. Now
they compare correctly.</li>
<li>Updated libraries and various minor code improvements.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.2.0</h3>
<ul>
<li>Updated libraries and various minor code improvements. This should
result in slightly improved performance in some cases.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.1.9</h3>
<ul>
<li>Updated the application, license, and documentation to use
<span class="tt">www.diffpdf.com</span> in favor of <span class="tt">www.qtrac.eu</span>. This should
make no practical difference since both domains are synonyms (which
map to <span class="tt">diffpdf.appspot.com</span> under the hood). We've done this in
case the rules for <span class="tt">.eu</span> domains change in the future.</li>
<li>Various library updates. Overall these result in our test suite
running noticably faster although the speed benefits vary from case to
case.</li>
<li>Fixed a tiny robustness issue for a very rare corner case.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.1.8</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a tiny subtle long-standing bug where setting
<code>normalize-hyphens</code>, <code>ignore-hyphens</code>, and
<code>normalize-ligatures</code>, in a <code>.ini</code> configuration
file, was ignored. Now they are correctly recognized.</li>
<li>Minor library updates.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.1.7</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added support for doing appearance mode comparisons with the “new”
renderer. In some rare cases the “old” renderer doesn't detect some
texture or gradient fill differences&mdash;but the new renderer does.</li>
<li>Minor library updates.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.1.6</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added support for the <code>-D</code> or <code>--maxdirdepth</code> option.
By default when comparing two folders of PDFs,
<code>com&shy;pare&shy;pdf&shy;cmd.exe</code> looks in the folders specified, <i>and</i>
their subfolders, and subsubfolders, and so on. Using <code>-D 1</code>
ensures that only the specified folders are looked in and all subfolders
are ignored.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that meant an error message was output at the start of
the <code>--help</code> text.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.1.5</h3>
<ul>
<li>When reading configuration and key files, ignores the BOM (byte
order mark) if present. (For example, Notepad sometimes saves files with
a BOM in UTF-8 mode.)</li>
<li>Updated libraries.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.1.4</h3>
<ul>
<li>Updated libraries, including the PDF library.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.1.3</h3>
<ul>
<li>The <code>cid.exe</code> application is no longer needed or supplied
(which is why the <code>.zip</code> is smaller), since
<code>com&shy;pare&shy;pdf&shy;cmd.exe</code> can now discover the Computer&nbsp;ID for
itself. This should make startup times slightly faster.</li>
<li>Updated libraries and various internal improvements.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.1.2</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug which meant that PNG reports sometimes showed the wrong
path.</li>
<li>(Internal changes: replaced <code>sharedlib</code> with
<code>libloading</code> for DLLs, and changed internal PDF-handling APIs;
replaced <code>error-chain</code> with <code>XError</code> and made minor
changes to some error messages.)</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.1.1</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added a new <code>.ini</code> configuration file option in the
<code>[report]</code> section, <code>show-field-content</code>. This defaults to
<code>false</code>. If you use a configuration file with this set to
<code>true</code>, then the content of form fields will be output in PDF
reports. (This is done automatically for other report formats.)</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.1.0</h3>
<ul>
<li>Updated libraries and various internal improvements.</li>
<li>Added support for annual license keys. These are not tied to the
hardware, so are ideal for virtual machines. However, they are only
available in selected countries to selected customers, and have a
minimum order, so the minimum purchase is at least $1,800 USD.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.0.2</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed some small bugs in messages about free trial expiry.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.0.1</h3>
<ul>
<li>Updated libraries and various internal improvements.</li>
<li>Fixed bug which could have made acquiring and registering a full
license key fail. (The web site now works around the bug, so registering
should always succeed even with version 2.0.0.)</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.0.0</h3>
<ul>
<li>Password-protected PDFs can now be compared if you give the
password(s) on the command line. (See the <code>--password1</code> and
<code>--password2</code> command line options.)</li>
<li>The colors used to highlight differences in PDF and PNG reports can
now be customized. (See the Color Options described in the manual.)</li>
<li>Difference reports can now be output in XML format, in addition to
CSV, JSON, PDF, and PNG.</li>
<li>By default JSON and XML reports are human-readable, but they can be
minimized using the <code>compact</code> configuration file option.</li>
<li>Updated libraries and various internal improvements.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1.3.0</h3>
<ul>
<li>Implemented an optimization which can improve speed by a few percent
in many cases.</li>
<li>Updated libraries and minor internal improvements.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1.2.2</h3>
<ul>
<li>Updated libraries and minor internal improvements.</li>
<li>Updated so that it is compatible with MyCommerce Share-IT Order IDs
as well as the old MyCommerce RegNow Order IDs.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1.2.1</h3>
<ul>
<li>Updated some libraries (bug fixes and a tiny speed improvement).</li>
<li>Improved some error handling and reporting.</li>
<li>Updated the license.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1.2.0</h3>
<ul>
<li>Updated to use a new PDF library that supports the new PDF&nbsp;2
standard, in addition to the existing PDF&nbsp;1.<i>x</i> standards that
previous versions support. In many use cases the new library uses less
memory and is faster.</li>
<li>Updated some of the other libraries com&shy;pare&shy;pdf&shy;cmd uses.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1.1.8</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added a new <code>.ini</code> configuration file option in the
<code>[report]</code> section, <code>path-in-title</code>. This defaults to
<code>true</code>, which means that the full path of compared PDFs is
included in reports. If set to <code>false</code>, then only the filenames
of compared PDFs is included.</li>
<li>Updated some of the libraries com&shy;pare&shy;pdf&shy;cmd uses.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1.1.7</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bug fix:&nbsp;The accuracy setting in a <code>.ini</code> configuration
file is no longer ignored.</li>
<li>Updated some of the libraries com&shy;pare&shy;pdf&shy;cmd uses.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1.1.6</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added a <code>scale</code> option which can be set in a <code>.ini</code>
configuration file's <code>[report]</code> section. This only affects PNG
reports. It allows PNG reports to have much higher resolution output if
required.</li>
<li>Updated some of the libraries com&shy;pare&shy;pdf&shy;cmd uses.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1.1.5</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added support for JSON reports (<code>.jsn</code> or <code>.json</code>).</li>
<li>Updated some of the libraries com&shy;pare&shy;pdf&shy;cmd uses.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1.1.4</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added a <code>highlight-transparency</code> option which can be set in a
<code>.ini</code> configuration file's <code>[general]</code> section. This
makes it possible for you to set the balance between how visible
the highlighting is vs.&nbsp;how clearly the highlighted differences
show through.</li>
<li>Changed the default highlight transparency to 80% for PDF difference
reports (before it was 85%). This makes the highlighting stronger, and
still leaves the differences visible. It also makes the highlighting
consistent with PNG reports whose default has always been 80%.
</ul>

<h3>1.1.3</h3>
<ul>
<li>Minor updates to the manual and libraries used by com&shy;pare&shy;pdf&shy;cmd.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1.1.2</h3>
<ul>
<li>Eliminated the dependency on the Windows <code>wmic</code> program by
bundling our <code>cid.exe</code> program in the package and using it to
obtain the Computer&nbsp;ID.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1.1.1</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bug fix: com&shy;pare&shy;pdf&shy;cmd now correctly prevents overwriting the PDF
files or folders being compared if the same file or folder is mistakenly
used as the report file or folder.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1.1.0</h3>
<ul>
<li>Running <code>com&shy;pare&shy;pdf&shy;cmd.exe try</code> will try to acquire <i>and
register</i> a free trial license key, so after running this command you
can freely use com&shy;pare&shy;pdf&shy;cmd for up to 20 days. </li>
<li>Added a <code>getkey</code> option. After you've bought one or more
licenses, to acquire a license on a particular computer, once
com&shy;pare&shy;pdf&shy;cmd has been installed on it, run <code>com&shy;pare&shy;pdf&shy;cmd.exe getkey
<i>order-id</i></code> where <code><i>order-id</i></code> is the Order&nbsp;ID
that appeared on the payment confirmation page (and which is also
emailed to you). This will take you to the “get key” page with both the
Order&nbsp;ID and Computer&nbsp;ID correctly filled in. Then, once
you've clicked the issue license key button, you can register the key
by running <code>com&shy;pare&shy;pdf&shy;cmd.exe register <i>key</i></code>.</li>
<li>Added a <code>-s</code> or <code>--show</code> option. If the PDFs are
different and <code>-r</code> or <code>--report</code> is used to get a PDF
report, this option will make com&shy;pare&shy;pdf&shy;cmd show the report in your PDF
reader.</li>
<li>Added a <code>-m</code> or <code>--manual</code> or <code>manual</code> option.
Use this option to show com&shy;pare&shy;pdf&shy;cmd's manual in your PDF reader.</li>
<li>If you use the <code>license</code> option, com&shy;pare&shy;pdf&shy;cmd will show the
license in your PDF reader rather than as text output to the console.</li>
<li>If you use the <code>try</code> or <code>buy</code> option, com&shy;pare&shy;pdf&shy;cmd
will try to open the web page you need to visit, in addition to
explaining how to get a free trial or buy a license key.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1.0.1</h3>
<ul>
<li>When comparing two <i>folders</i> of PDF files, report folders and
subfolder are now only created when necessary, i.e., when there are
differences to save in a report.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1.0.0</h3>
<ul>
<li>First public release of this diffpdfc alternative.</li>
</ul>
