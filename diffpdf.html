DiffPDF v6.2.0-pe is provided with a comprehensive <a

Use DiffPDF to compare PDF files quickly and easily:
<br>Click to choose one PDF; click to choose another PDF; click Compare.
<br>The changes are shown as if you'd used highlighter pens to show
added, changed, or deleted text.
</p>
<p>
This Windows application is our easiest to use and most affordable and
popular product. Some customers report it as superior in functionality
and far faster than Adobe Acrobat's Diff tool.Your PDFs are safely
compared on your own computer without the size or page limits of online
tools.
</p>

<p>
Comparisons can be made based on the text
regardless of layout, or based on appearance (which accounts for fonts,
colors, layout, diagrams, images, etc.)
</p>

<p>
DiffPDF is useful for anyone who needs to compare PDFs, reports, books,
or labels&mdash;for example, archivists, engineers, journalists,
linguists, packagers, publishers, researchers, software testers, and
translators. DiffPDF is used in a wide range of contexts, from book
authors to banks, insurance companies, and Government. (<a
href="diffpdf.html#screen">Screenshots</a>.)
</p>

If you require a console-based command line tool, use <a
href="comparepdfcmd.html">com&shy;pare&shy;pdf&shy;cmd</a>.
</p>
</div>

<!-- MANUAL
<p>
The manual can be viewed when the program is running by clicking the
Help button then the Help menu option. The license is available from
within the program.
</p>

<h2 id="screen">Screenshots</h2>

<p>
The first screenshot shows how easy DiffPDF is to use: choose the two
PDFs to compare, then click the Compare button. (<a href="#top">Top</a>)
</p>

<p><img src="images/diffpdf6-main1_M1.png" alt="Image diffpdf6-main1_M1.png" width="400" height="301"><img src="images/diffpdf6-main1_M2.png" alt="Image diffpdf6-main1_M2.png" width="400" height="301"><img src="images/diffpdf6-main1_M3.png" alt="Image diffpdf6-main1_M3.png" width="177" height="301"></p>

<p>
By default DiffPDF highlights deleted text in red, inserted text in
cyan, and replaced text in magenta. All the colors can be customized, or
plain highlighting can be chosen. The change bar color, thickness, and
indent can also be customized&mdash;or the change bar can be hidden
entirely. (<a href="#top">Top</a>)
</p>

<p><img src="images/diffpdf6-main2_M1.png" alt="Image diffpdf6-main2_M1.png" width="400" height="318"><img src="images/diffpdf6-main2_M2.png" alt="Image diffpdf6-main2_M2.png" width="363" height="318"></p>

<p>
In this screenshot we see that the control panel can be switched to the
right, and the view panels can be set to be vertical&mdash;useful for
PDFs that are much wider than they are tall. (All four possible layout
options are supported.)
</p>

<p>
What the screenshots don't show is that DiffPDF can produce
reports&mdash;either a PDF that matches what's seen on the screen, or
textual reports. Nor do the screenshots reveal all the options that are
available. For example, it is possible to exclude corners and/or margins
and/or arbitrary rectangles
from consideration when comparing, which is ideal for excluding
timestamps. It is also possible to compare ranges of pages to account
for inserted and deleted pages. All DiffPDF's functionality is explained
in the manual, and, of course, you can
<a href="diffpdf.html#trybuy">try it before buying it</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="png">Example Comparison</h2>

<p>
Here is an example comparison that shows how DiffPDF indicates
differences between two PDFs whose pages are slightly different:
</p>

<p><img src="images/report-2_M1.png" alt="Image report-2_M1.png" width="400" height="598"><img src="images/report-2_M2.png" alt="Image report-2_M2.png" width="400" height="598"><img src="images/report-2_M3.png" alt="Image report-2_M3.png" width="355" height="598"></p>

<p>
By default, change bars are shown in red, and changes are highlighted
with deletions in red, insertions in cyan, and replacements in magenta.
In this example, the red and cyan highlighting indicates text that has
moved (i.e., been deleted from one place and inserted in another). And
the magenta highlighting indicates text that has been replaced in its
original position. (Note that if plain rather than change highlighting
is used&mdash;which is the default&mdash;all differences are shown in
yellow.) All colors can be changed, as can the width of the change bar
and many other things.
</p>

<p>
The image above shows what appears on-screen in DiffPDF's user
interface. DiffPDF can also output PDF reports which contain each pair
of differing pages with the differences highlighted as shown above.
