</div>

<div class="indent">
<p>
I consider this to be a really excellent book—both for its <i>design</i>
ideas and for its C++. It is aimed at experienced C++ developers who
want to stay up-to-date and raise their game. I learnt a huge amount
from this book and strongly recommend it.

</div>

<div class="indent">
<p>
Crafting Interpreters is one of the most inspiring, enjoyable&mdash;and
useful&mdash;programming textbooks I've ever read. The writing style is
engaging and accessible, the emphasis strongly practical. Theory is
provided when necessary, and clearly explained.
</p>

<p>
The first part of the book uses Java, the second uses C; but it doesn't
matter whether you know either, the exposition is so clear you can
easily translate in your head or at the keyboard into the language
you're most familiar with.
</p>

<p>
If you want to create&mdash;or simply understand <i>how</i> to
create&mdash;a language, DSL, or file format, this book will take you
further than any other I've ever read. It certainly slays the dragon of
first time programming language implementation.

Freedom to Think

    <div class="biblio2">
    Susie Alegre (Atlantic Books; 2022)
    </div>
</div>

<div class="indent">
<p>
This book is essential reading for anyone involved with software
development (programmers, designers, psychologists, managers, etc.).
It clearly explains the practical and legal impacts of software
(especially AI, social media, and online advertising) on users (both
adults and children). It shows how our thinking can be influenced both
for the purpose of selling products and political positions, and how the
law can be used&mdash;and in some cases needs to be strengthened and
extended&mdash;to protect our freedom of thought.

Learning Go: An Idiomatic Approach to Real-World Go Programming
<br>
    <div class="biblio2">
    Jon Bodner (O'Reilly Media; 2021)
    </div>
</div>

<div class="indent">
<p>
This book is aimed at existing programmers of languages other than Go
(or those who've been away from Go for a few years).
</p>

<p>
Written more than a decade after Go's 1.0 release, in addition to
teaching the Go language itself, this book illustrates many useful Go
programming patterns. For example, the book shows now-standard ways of
doing Go concurrent programming, as well as how to make best use of Go's
evolved features for modules, contexts, and error wrapping. And the book
finishes with a short but useful introduction to Go's support for
generics.
</p>

<p>
A genuinely useful introduction and guide to modern Go programming, this
book also highlights Go's few misfeatures and how to avoid being caught
out by them. Strongly recommended.

Your Computer Is on Fire

    <div class="biblio2">
    Editors:&nbsp;Thomas S. Mullaney, Benjamin Peters, Mar Hicks, Kavita Philip
    (The MIT Press; 2021)
    </div>
</div>

<div class="indent">
<p>
This is a collection of essays designed to provoke thought and debate
about the uses and impact of computing on society.
</p>

<p>
The essays range from those about the physical infrastructure&mdash;for
example, the “cloud” may appear to be <i>virtual</i>, but actually runs
on huge numbers of computers in very large power-hungry
data-centers&mdash;to the human aspects. For example, no matter how many
or how diverse are the children taught to program, if big companies
primarily hire and promote those from a narrow spectrum, then the
software they produce will likely only suit people like themselves.
</p>

<p>
Back in the twentieth-century, for most programmers, ethics was really
just concerned with professionalism:&nbsp;being honest about timescales
and what was possible and working to the highest standards ones
abilities and the available tools and hardware made possible. But
nowadays, the ethical aspect is much wider, from who decides how an
autonomous vehicle should behave to all the topics covered in this book.
</p>

<p>
This book would be a beneficial addition to the reading (and debating)
list for any undergraduate course that had any computing or management
modules. Recommended.

    Shoshana Zuboff (PublicAffairs; 2020)
    </div>
</div>

<div class="indent">
<p>
This book could usefully be read by every practicing and aspiring
computer scientist, data scientist, programmer, and those who manage
them. It will make you think about the work you do and for whom, about
the interface between your work and ethics and law, and above all on the
impact of your work on society.
</p>

<p>
Prior to reading this book I believed that when things went wrong (e.g.,
Google's collection of private WiFi data during Street View journeys, or
Facebook's repeated selling of private data), it was due to genuine
error or rogue “bad actors” as the companies' claimed. Now I understand
that these things (done by Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Verizon,
and so on) are matters of policy, and that lying about what they're
really doing is standard practice.
</p>

<p>
Naturally, I don't expect anyone to take my word for it. I strongly
recommend reading this book. It is easy to read and fully referenced so
you can check its sources for yourself.

    </div>
</div>

<div class="indent">
<p>
This is an ideal book for less experienced or less formally trained
programmers wanting to improve the quality of their coding.</p>

<p>
The book is essentially a list of recipes that show how do do various
code improvements in a reliable and systematic way.
</p>

<p>
All but one example is illustrated using JavaScript, but all the code is
very easy to understand, and the ideas and practices are applicable
to&mdash;and easily translatable to&mdash;any modern object-oriented
programming language.
</p>

<p>
Each recipe is small, self-contained, and well explained. And here and
there the author has injected tiny sparks of leavening humour.

<div class="indent">
<p>
This is a non-programming book that is nonetheless worth reading by every
programmer, would-be programmer, and anyone else involved with or
interested in software.
</p>

<p>
The book provides information and insights into programmer psychology,
into how and why certain groups are excluded or underrepresented in
programming&mdash;and what the effects of this are. It also addresses
some ideas for remedies. It examines the pressures that developers and
software companies are under and the impacts these have on corporate
behavior and the practical and ethical results.
</p>

<p>
This book is thought-provoking and full of ideas and facts about
software developers, software development, and software companies. It
will deepen anyone's understanding of how, why, and by whom software
gets written, and what the consequences are. Highly recommended.

</div>

<div class="indent">
<p>
The Java language has evolved quite a lot since the 1990s, incorporating
modern features like lambdas and generics. This book (and its companion,
Volume II) covers the fully up-to-date modern language, as well as the
most important and widely used parts of the standard library.
</p>
<p>
What I particularly like about this book is that it explains points of
contention (e.g., how to implement <code>equals()</code>), <i>and</i>
provides the arguments on the different possibilities and the rationale
for the choices made in the book.
</p>
<p>
Another aspect I like is that in some cases the book provides useful
code snippets or classes to supplement Java out-of-the-box. Overall,
this book is ideal for programmers of other languages who want to learn
modern Java.

<div id="rustpl" class="biblio">
The Rust Programming Language
<br>
<div class="biblio2">
Steve Klabnik and Carol Nichols (No Starch Press; 2018)
</div>
</div>

<div class="indent">
<p>
Rust is a modern language that can be used to create applications and
systems of all kinds. The language uses aggregation and traits rather
than inheritance. The Rust compiler does extensive code analysis to make
it impossible to introduce data races in concurrent code, and generally
eliminates whole categories of potential errors that C/C++ compilers are
defenceless against. The compiler uses the LLVM toolchain, so produces
fast-running executables. Rust's build tool, <code>cargo</code>, is a
pleasure to use.
</p>
<p>
This book teaches Rust from scratch, but assumes some programming
knowledge. It is Rust's official textbook and is freely available <a
href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/">online</a>. The early part of the
book is a bit uneven&mdash;alternating between baby steps and being more
demanding, but it does give good overall coverage of the language. The
book goes beyond being a mere introduction in that it explains some
subtle and important Rust features including interior mutability and key
patterns of use, especially for concurrency. However, no mention is made
of the excellent and easy-to-use concurrency provided by the
<code>rayon</code> crate. The error handling coverage is barely adequate,
with no mention of the <code>error-chain</code>, <code>failure</code>, or
<code>quick-error</code> crates.
</p>
<p>
This book will be useful to anyone starting out with Rust. In addition
to covering the language and glimpses of the standard library, it
illustrates good Rust style, something not always obvious (for Rust or
any language) simply by reading the documentation.
</p>
</div>

<br>
    <div class="biblio2">
Ashok P. Nadkarni (self-published; 2017)
    </div>
</div>

<div class="indent">
<p>
This book covers the Tcl language and library. In addition it covers
many useful parts of Tcllib (Tcl's standard library), and some
third-party libraries. The coverage includes cross-platform differences
and practical advice based on real experience with the language.
</p>
<p>
This is the first self-published book I've ever read that could be
published as-is by a reputable publisher. Overall it is well-written and
interesting. And unlike Ousterhout's book it covers Tcl's
object-oriented features. (However, it doesn't cover GUI programming
with Tk, so for that <a href="#tcltk">Ousterhout</a>'s book remains
essential.)
</p>

Programming Rust
<br>
<div class="biblio2">
Jim Blandy &amp; Jason Orendorff (O'Reilly Media; 2017)
</div>
</div>

<div class="indent">
<p>
This book teaches Rust to programmers of other languages. Given the
dearth of good Rust books, this book is certainly worth reading. It
covers the Rust language pretty fully, although it doesn't cover much of
the standard library, or have much to say about third-party libraries.
The book introduces the novel and advanced feature of “lifetimes” rather
early, which would have been fine if the subject had been returned to
later on to explain how and when to use owned and borrowed data in
structs. The index is poor. Overall, this book is adequate for getting
to grips with all the basics, and is sufficient to get people to the
point of writing their own small programs. A lot more reading elsewhere
will be required to progress further though.

Alex Martelli, Anna Ravenscroft, &amp; Steve Holden (O'Reilly; 2017)

<div class="indent">
<p>
This book presents the entire Python language (2.7&ndash;3.6), many
parts of the standard library, and some important third-party libraries.
It is ideal for beginner/intermediate Python programmers who want to
broaden their knowledge with a useful overview; and for those moving
from other languages to Python. The book provides sufficient
introduction to get started with many major topics in Python
programming, and usually provides links for where to get further
information. The coverage of Python&nbsp;2.7 is unfortunate since it
complicates and confuses the text in places.

<div class="indent">
<p>
Scala is a hybrid object-oriented&mdash;functional language for the Java
Virtual Machine. The language itself is large and interesting. And this
book is an excellent introduction. In fact, this book could be taken as
a model of how to write a programming language textbook. The
explanations are crystal clear using appropriate technical terminology
(that's properly explained), and liberally illustrated with readable and
understandable examples throughout. For anyone coming from a procedural
or object-oriented programming background&mdash;and for anyone
considering writing a programming textbook&mdash;this book is well worth
reading.

This is essential reading&mdash;in addition to the <a
href="#pycookbook">Python Cookbook</a> and my own <a
href="pipbook.html">Python in Practice</a>&mdash;for any Python programmer
(beginner to intermediate) who wants to broaden and deepen their
understanding of Python. The book is wide-ranging and interesting with
the occasional flash of humor. It includes an introduction to using
Python&nbsp;3.4's <code>asyncio</code> module. The only weak area is the
coverage of meta-programming which is rather short and superficial; but
the rest of the book is really excellent.

On the positive side the book illustrates many useful, powerful, and
advanced features of standard SQL, and is packed with interesting advice
and information. On the negative side the prose is often poorly written
and is littered with typos; and sadly, the typos extend into some of the
examples too. Apart from the typo caveats, this book should be useful
for anyone looking to move more of their code out of their procedural
language and into pure SQL, and for anyone wanting to deepen and broaden
their SQL knowledge.

<div class="indent">
<p>
This is a well-written textbook ideal for computer science
undergraduates or anyone else who wants to understand the design and
performance of data structures and algorithms. Naturally all the
examples are in Java, but the performance analysis generally applies to
the same data structures and algorithms regardless of language. In fact,
porting some of the code to another language would probably lead to an
even deeper understanding. Although for those who like Java itself,
there are plenty of graded exercises provided.

This unusual and interesting book takes a simple programming problem and
presents over thirty different implementations, each illustrating a
different programming style. This approach makes it very clear how the
different styles differ, and the accompanying explanations help with
understanding the trade-offs. The examples are in Python&nbsp;2 and

This book is mostly focused on Python&nbsp;2.7 with a few remarks about

technologies. The book will be of most benefit to two kinds of reader:
those doing large scale processing on a single machine (e.g., big
numeric computations), and those doing large scale processing more
generally (e.g., using clusters or cloud computing). Apart from the
early chapters which go into reasonable depth, most of the rest
provides introductory material on techniques and technologies to get you

Ignore the "Seven Weeks" silliness&mdash;this is a really well written
and interesting book that looks deeply into the major approaches to
doing concurrency. The book covers all the pitfalls as well as showing
the benefits, and is written in an accessible style that any moderately
experienced programmer should be able to understand. The examples are in
different languages since some approaches to concurrency are available
only in particular languages, but are well explained and easy to follow
even if you don't know the language concerned. This book serves as
an excellent introduction to concurrency, although experienced
concurrent programmers should also find much of interest. C++

This is a good introduction to 3D graphics using OpenGL, suitable for
programmers without prior 3D graphics experience. The examples are
written in C++, but the OpenGL APIs are usually pretty faithfully
reproduced in bindings for other languages (e.g., <a
href="https://pyopengl.sourceforge.net/">PyOpenGL</a> for Python), so the
book's examples can be used without too much adaptation.

<p>
This book is full of interesting and practical ideas covering all
aspects of Python&nbsp;3 programming. I have two caveats. First, some
of the ideas for improved efficiency only seem to work well for
unrealistic examples. Second, some of the more advanced examples show
what <i>can</i> be done&mdash;but not necessarily what one <i>ought</i>
to do when writing maintainable code. Nonetheless, every Python
programmer should buy and read this book.

<p>
This book provides a thorough introduction to multithreaded programming,
including small but complete working examples (in Java) that demonstrate
all the key techniques. The last chapter provides a brief introduction
to transactional memory, one of the hopes for a higher-level approach to
threading that doesn't burden programmers with all the petty bookkeeping
details that conventional techniques demand. This is not light reading,
but worthwhile for those who really want to <i>understand</i>
multithreaded concurrency rather than simply use it through their
language's libraries. Incidentally, the links are to the revised
reprint, I only have the original.

threads), see

This is an unusual and valuable book. Each chapter covers a different
open source application and is written by one of the application's lead
developers. Each chapter gives a brief introduction to what the software
does and then goes on to explain the overall architecture, the rationale
for the key decisions, and concludes with a brief assessment of the
project's successes and failures. Anyone interested in building larger

something of interest in this book.

The D Programming Language

    <div class="biblio2">Andrei Alexandrescu (Addison Wesley; 2010)</div>
</div>

<div class="indent">
<p>
D is a very interesting language. It is much easier to learn and use
than C++ or Rust, yet offers many of the benefits of those languages,
plus many additional&mdash;and useful&mdash;features unique to D. It is
rather sad that D has not had the attention of other languages (such as
the far less capable Go), and so D is not especially well supported
either in terms of documentation or third-party libraries. Nonetheless
for non-GUI programs D has much to offer.
</p>
<p>
Although rather old, this book remains by far the best book on D. It is
well structured and clearly written in a good humored and accessible
style. It is aimed at those who can already program rather than
beginners.

Using SQLite
<br>
<div class="biblio2">Jay A. Kreibich (O'Reilly Media; 2010)</div>
</div>

<div class="indent">
<p>
Don't be put off by the “Lite” in SQLite&mdash;SQLite is a real database
with excellent SQL support. SQLite is very widely deployed and is useful
not only as a conventional SQL database but also as a single-file file
store for application data. This book shows how to use SQLite to create,
modify, and query databases. It also serves as a good introduction to
SQL since it doesn't assume prior knowledge of SQL. In addition to being
a fine tutorial, the book is also a good reference. SQLite is accessible
to any language which can access C libraries (pretty well all
languages).
For example, Python includes built-in support for SQLite with its
<code>sqlite3</code> module; but I recommend using <a
href="https://rogerbinns.github.io/apsw/">APSW</a> instead since it is
far superior, offering as much access to SQLite as C programmers get but
through a nice Python API.

The book's title is an accurate description. The fourth edition has been
updated to cover both Python&nbsp;2.6 and Python&nbsp;3.0. Most of the
book is devoted to Python's standard library as well as covering
more advanced features such as extending Python with C libraries and
embedding the Python interpreter into other programs. Personally, I find
David's <a href="#pycookbook">Python Cookbook</a> more useful and
interesting.

<p>
This is the standard text on Tcl/Tk&nbsp;8.5. Tcl is an unconventional,
almost syntax-free language. It is worth learning about simply because
it is so different from almost anything else, and the ability to write
lightweight cross-platform GUI programs with it is a useful bonus.

This book addresses many “tactical” issues in programming: good naming,
function design, refactoring, and similar. The book has many interesting
and useful ideas that should help any programmer improve their coding
style and make their programs more maintainable. The book's examples
are in Java, but in most cases they are applicable to any

Mastering Regular Expressions
<br>
<div class="biblio2">Jeffrey E. F. Friedl (3rd edition; O'Reilly Media;

</div>

<div class="indent">
<p>
This is the standard text on regular expressions&mdash;a very interesting
and useful book. Most of the coverage is understandably devoted to
Perl&mdash;which probably has more regular expression features than any
other tool. In addition to its coverage of regular expressions
generally, it has specific chapters devoted to Perl, Java, .NET, and PHP
regular expressions. Incidentally, a different kind of regular
expression engine was created for Google by Russ Cox&mdash;<a
href="https://code.google.com/p/re2/">re2</a>&mdash;which is well worth
reading about.
Although specific coverage of Python isn't present in the book,
since Python supports a large subset of what Perl provides (plus
Python's own <code>?P</code> extensions), the book is still very useful to
Python programmers. Furthermore, an excellent and well-established and
much more powerful and more Unicode-friendly Python regular expression
library is available from PyPI: <a

This book takes a strategic&mdash;project-oriented&mdash;approach rather
than a tactical&mdash;code-oriented&mdash;one, as it explains the
software development process and how to manage it. I still have this
book and it sticks in my memory because while I was reading it I was
working on a software project that made just about every mistake the
