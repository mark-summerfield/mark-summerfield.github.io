<p>
The EU's Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) became law in 2024 and allowed a
three year grace period for compliance.
</p>

<p>
We believe that it would have been impossible for a small business such
as Qtrac Ltd's was to achieve compliance with the Act. This resulted in
Qtrac Ltd. stopping all sales into Europe and cost the company about
half of its sales as well as many disgruntled customers.
</p>

<p>
It appears to us that the CRA was written by one of the big
consultancies to generate as much consulting compliance revenue as
possible, and at the same time squeezing out small businesses that can
neither comply on their own nor afford to hire a consulting company to
do the compliance for them. After all, the CRA demands that even the
smallest one-person software company must achieve the same compliance as
a software giant like Microsoft.
</p>

<p>
The CRA lacks proper provision for small businesses, exposing them to
considerable legal risk, extra bureaucracy, and the additional risks of
predatory legal action, all of which makes selling into Europe extremely
unattractive.
</p>

<p>
Overall, the CRA is bad news for European software innovation and will
ensure that Europe lags even further behind the US and elsewhere in
years to come.
</p>

<p>
<i>Note that an early draft of the CRA was also extremely prejudicial to
FOSS (free open source software) developers. However, the CRA's final
text has been considerably amended to address the needs of FOSS
developers. Overall it seems safe to develop FOSS—providing the software
does not fall into any of the categories listed in
