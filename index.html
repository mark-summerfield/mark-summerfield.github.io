This website is the “remains” of the Qtrac Ltd. website
(<code>www.qtrac.eu</code>).
</p>
</div>

<p>
Qtrac Ltd. was founded in 2006, traded until 2024, and was wound up in
2025.
</p>

<p>
The “Qtrac” in Qtrac Ltd. stood for “Quality Training Research And
Consultancy”. Qtrac Ltd. began with the intention of providing
programming training courses. However, in its first eight years it
mostly earned money from the books written by <a
href="marksummerfield.html">Mark Summerfield</a> its owner and sole
employee, plus income from providing technical writing services and
programming training courses. During Qtrac Ltd.'s last decade, most of
its income was generated by license sales of its PDF comparison
products, in particular the <a href="diffpdf.html">DiffPDF</a> GUI
application and the more technical <a
href="comparepdfcmd.html">comparepdfcmd</a> tool (itself the successor
to the diffpdfc tool). In 2023 Qtrac Ltd. stopped selling its software
to European customers due to the EU's <a href="cra.html">Cyber
Resiliance Act</a>. This cost Qtrac Ltd. about half its sales.
Nonetheless the company continued. For almost eleven years Qtrac Ltd.
sold its software using Digital River/MyCommerce (DRMC) to handle the
payments. Unfortunately, from mid-2024 DRMC stopped passing on the money
it received to its customers. This led directly to Qtrac Ltd.'s closure
in 2025.

<p>
We also produce some free open source software, mostly small libraries
and utilities, many listed in the <a href="sitemap.html">Site Map</a>.
And many years ago we also created a free open source DiffPDF
application, now long maintained by others.
</p>

<p>
All of our books are published by <a
href="https://www.informit.com">InformIT (Pearson Education)</a>,
although they are all out of date now with no prospect of new editions.
