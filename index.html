<h2 style="margin-top: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Mark Summerfield</h2>

<p>
I produce some free open source software, mostly small libraries and
utilities, many listed in the <a href="sitemap.html">Site Map</a>. And
many years ago I also created a free open source DiffPDF application,
now long maintained by others.
</p>

<p>
All of my books are published by <a
href="https://www.informit.com">Pearson Education</a> (under various
imprints), although they are all out of date now with no prospect of new
editions.
</p>

<p>
<a href="marksummerfield.html">A bit about me</a>; I can be contacted
as m.n.summerfield (gmail—dot com).

<h2 id="qtrac" style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Qtrac Ltd.</h2>

<p>
I founded Qtrac Ltd. in 2006. The company traded until 2024, and was
wound up in 2025. Its website was <code>www.qtrac.eu</code>.
</p>

<p>
The “Qtrac” in Qtrac Ltd. stood for “Quality Training Research And
Consultancy”. Qtrac Ltd. began with the intention of providing
programming training courses. However, in its first eight years it
mostly earned money from the books written by <a
href="marksummerfield.html">me</a> its owner and sole
employee, plus income from providing technical writing services and
programming training courses. During Qtrac Ltd.'s last decade, most of
its income was generated by license sales of its PDF comparison
products, in particular the <a href="diffpdf.html">DiffPDF</a> GUI
application and the more technical <a
href="comparepdfcmd.html">comparepdfcmd</a> tool (itself the successor
to the diffpdfc tool). In 2023 Qtrac Ltd. stopped selling its software
to European customers due to the EU's <a href="cra.html">Cyber
Resiliance Act</a>. This cost Qtrac Ltd. about half its sales.
Nonetheless the company continued. For almost eleven years Qtrac Ltd.
sold its software using Digital River/MyCommerce (DRMC) to handle the
payments. Unfortunately, from mid-2024 DRMC stopped passing on the money
it received to its customers. DRMC went bankrupt in early 2025. This led
directly to Qtrac Ltd.'s closure in 2025.
